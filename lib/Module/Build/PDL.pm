# Our goal is to put pd ahead of pm and xs, since pd files create pm and xs files,

=head1 NAME

Module::Build::PDL - A Module::Build class for building PDL projects.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Module::Build::PDL version 0.0.2, a very
rough version indeed.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Module::Build::PDL;
    
    my $builder = Module::Build::PDL->new(
        dist_name         => 'PDL-My-Mod',
        license             => 'perl',
        dist_author         => 'David Mertens <mertens2@illinois.edu>',
        dist_version_from   => 'lib/PDL/My/Mod.pm',
        requires => {
            'Test::More' => 0,
            'version'    => 0,
            'PDL'        => 0,
        },
        add_to_cleanup      => [ 'PDL-My-Mod-*' ],
    );
    
    $builder->create_build_script();

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Module::Build::PDL is to PDL distributions what Module::Build is to most
perl distributions.  The only difference between the two (at the moment)
is that Module::Build::PDL knows how to handle .pd files (files that
use PDL::PP to generate compiled PDL functions).

Although I should probably give a basic tutorial here at some point,
for now I will simply tell you to refer to L<Module::Build> for an
explanation of how to use C<Build> files and L<Module::Build::Authoring>
for an explanation of how to use the module itself in your own
distributions.

See L</CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT> below for details on how to set
up your distribution.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

None yet, but surely I need to add some.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

To create a M::B::PDL build, you should probably begin with something like
L<Module::Starter>.  Then edit the C<Build.PL> file so that it uses
C<Module::Build::PDL> instead of C<Module::Build>.

The use (by C<Module::Build>) of the lib directory is important.  Here
is a brief explanation if you are not familiar with how this works.
Suppose you want to install a pure-perl module called My::Foo::Bar.  You
would put the file Bar.pm in the directory C<lib/My/Foo>.  Anything you
put in C<lib/> will be processed, so you don't need to tell the builder
anything about where to look for your files.  This means that if you
wanted to distribute multiple modules C<My::Foo>, C<My::Foo::Base>,
C<My::Foo::Bar>, and C<PDL::My::Foo>, your directory structure should
look something like this:

 Build.PL
 Changes
 ignore.txt
 MANIFEST
 README
 lib/
  My/
   Foo.pm
   Foo/
    Base.pm
    Bar.pm
  PDL/
   My/
    Foo.pm

In other words, put the files in lib where you would expect to find them
once everything is compiled and installed.

So far, I've only described what C<Module::Build> does.  The only new
capability provided by C<Module::Build::PDL> (so far) is that if you
have a .pd file in your C<lib/> directory, C<Module::Build::PDL> will
properly process it for you.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<PDL>, L<Module::Build>

None known.

=head1 TODO

I have a number of things that I need to add to this module.

=over

=item 1. Typemaps

Right now, you must manually include the typemap.pdl file in you lib
directory.  This could easily be automatically copied over during the
object creation process, but I've not yet implemented it.

=item 2. External Dependencies

I need to add some sort of systematized method for checking for external
dependencies.  This will require some thought and planning.  At the
moment, I think that we should put a separate directory in the
distribution's root directory called C<ext_dep> or some such thing.  Any
module that depends on an external dependency - and which should not be
compiled if that external dependency is not found - should have an
identically named test file in C<ext_dep>.  For example, to create
C<PDL::My::Foo>, you would have the files C<lib/PDL/My/Foo.pd> and
C<ext_dep/PDL/My/Foo.pm>.  The C<ext_dep> file would be 'used' and its
return value would determine if the external dependency could be found.
This would also need to have a natural extension for subdirectories,
where C<GSL> is a good example.

=item 3. Automatic M::B::PDL Dependence

This module needs to have a build-in dependence on itself, naturally.

=item 4. Only create the .xs and .pm files on change

Right now the build process always runs C<PDL::PP> on every .pd file,
regardless of whether or not it's changed.  This is handy when I'm
trying to debug C<Module::Build::PDL>, but it is not at all in the
keeping of a proper build process.

=item 5. Better documentation

Obviously.

=item 6. Tests

I'm not even quite sure how to write tests for this, but they really
should be done.

=back

=head1 BUGS, LIMITATIONS, AND SUPPORT

First see TODO above.

You have a number of avenues in which you can report bugs, submit ideas,
or get help.  These include:

=over

=item Make an Annotation

If you have any module documentation recommendations or suggestions,
you should note them on AnnoCPAN.  I intend to check the annotations on
a regular basis and incorporate them into my documentation on a regular
basis.  This module's annotations are located at
L<http://annocpan.org/dist/Module-Build-PDL>.

=item Help via Email

Although this is a free-standing module, it will (hopefully soon) be
moved into L<PDL>.  As such, you can probably get help from the PDL
mailing list, which is explained here: L<http://pdl.perl.org/maillists/>

=item Report a Bug or Feature Request

You can send bugs and feature requests to
C<bug-module-build-pdl@rt.cpan.org>, or submit them through the web
interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
